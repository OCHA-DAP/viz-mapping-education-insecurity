The demonstrators included veterans, lawmakers, off-duty police officers, members of several militias and far-right groups (Sons of Liberty New Jersey, Groypers, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, Boogaloo Boys, Three Percenters (III%), NSC-13), supporters of QAnon, and other groups, including 100 members of Moore County Citizens for Freedom and the organizers, The Silent Majority, and the Eighty Percent Coalition. Leading up to the event, President Trump hosted the 'Save America March' in front of the White House, calling for demonstrators to march to the Capitol building and 'fight like hell', while Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, called for 'trial by combat.' Over 100 Republican lawmakers were planning to object to the certification of the electoral college votes on that day. 1 IED was found on the Capitol grounds. Around 1 pm, hundreds of rioters stormed and occupied the US Capitol Building for 4 hours, disrupting the certification and causing the evacuation of lawmakers from the Congressional chambers. It has been found that the Proud Boys were key instigators in storming the Capitol. When rioters pressed toward the Capitol, many Capitol Police officers simply retreated, not making any apparent effort to physically block rioters from gaining access to the Capitol building. One officer was even seen taking a picture with a rioter. Rioters outnumbered the Capitol Police, although there had been numerous warnings online about possible unrest. Some rioters scaled the sides of the Capitol building, broke windows, damaged doors and offices, and looted. One group constructed makeshift gallows in front of the Capitol. Rioters were tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed, and hit with pepper balls and smoke bombs by police. About 1100 troops from the National Guard were activated and deployed in the city by Vice President Mike Pence after the Capitol was breached. Some of the rioters inside the Capitol building had socks filled with metal objects and hit officers in the head, causing multiple injuries; others pepper-sprayed and hit officers and FBI agents with metal pipes and chemical irritants. Some rioters carried zip-tie handcuffs with them. Rioters assaulted and threatened at least 6 members of the media and destroyed media equipment outside. One journalist was hit with rubber bullets by rioters; others were briefly detained by police while covering the event. Two rioters and one police officer were killed as a direct result of the riot, while another two rioters succumbed to medical conditions. Of the rioters, Ashli Babbitt was shot by police while trying to climb through a broken door into the Speaker's Lobby, which would have given her access to the House of Representatives chamber. Another rioter, Rosanne Boyland, was reportedly trampled during one of the clashes between police and demonstrators outside the Capitol. Brian Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer, died after being dragged and beaten by rioters while defending the building. More than 50 police officers were injured, and at least 150 people have been arrested, including at least nine veterans and one woman who stole Nancy Pelosi's laptop with intent to sell it to Russian intelligence authorities. Members of Congress reconvened around 8pm to certify President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. After the riot, one US Capitol Police Officer committed suicide and multiple other officers have been reported as threatening self-harm.
